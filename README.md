# Java-Mini-Project
This Java project simplifies hospital operations by replacing manual tasks with a user-friendly digital interface. It uses JOptionPane for the interface and Scanner for user input. There is no server-side code included in it, it is pure Java. Inspired by hospital needs, it streamlines processes like appointment scheduling and bill management, improving efficiency and user experience. Once logged in, staff can easily access options like checking doctor details, scheduling appointments, or handling emergencies. The appointment scheduling process is straightforward, guiding staff through entering patient information and selecting preferred appointment times and doctors. The interface is designed for simplicity, enabling staff to focus on patient care rather than struggling with complex technology.
